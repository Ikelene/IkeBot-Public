# IkeBot-Public
old code for IkeBot, before the major revamp. This code is now free to use.
Make sure `discord.py` is installed.
## idk if u are gonna run it to use in your bot you have to do the following first.

1. Change the code to your github repository if you want to change the code. Leave it the way it is if not.
2. Make sure to specify that your bot is based off of the old IkeBot code.
3. idk go wild

you need to know basic python to do anything meaningfull with this code.
